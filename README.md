ðŸš¢ Embark on a Journey with Our Real-Time Ship Telemetry Monitoring System

This project not only simulates and processes but also visualises 'real-time telemetry data' from ships in transit from various locations (e.g., Athens, Rome, Cappadocia) to Southampton, providing immediate and relevant insights.

It demonstrates **streaming IoT analytics**, using:
- **Kafka** for real-time telemetry ingestion
- **Duckdb** for efficient analytics storage
- **PySpark** for streaming ETL
- **Streamlit** for live dashboard visualisation
- **Python** for ship movement simulation
